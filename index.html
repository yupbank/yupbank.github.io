  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
	I am a staff data developer at Shopify and a Ph.D. Candidate at Telecom Paris.
	My research interests are traditional machine learning and primary decision trees. I like applying combinatorial optimization and computational geometry methods to machine learning algorithms.
	I'm also interested in big data problems in general.
	Before Shopify, I also worked at Lenovo Machine Intelligence Center, Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, and SOHU.
	I get my Bachelor's degree from <a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/">UESTC(University of Electronic Science and Technology of China)</a> in 2011, and my Master's degree from <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html">CUHK(The Chinese University of Hong Kong)</a> in 2013.
